# Garden

Garden (formerly SCN Now) is a small application I wrote for myself which lets me quickly write small other applications and access them from one central place.

The goal of this application is to allow me to quickly prototype ideas or functions, regardless of size, complexity, or need for local resources. The ability to go form vauge concept (prototype input methods for a health application diary function, for example) or need for a function (like to turn on/off automated desk lights) to a usable and easily accessable application helps increase productivity in addition to creating an outlet for general experimentation.

I guess? Enjoy.
